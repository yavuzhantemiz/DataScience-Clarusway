In this assignment, you must apply ***EDA*** processes for the development of predictive models. Handling outliers, domain knowledge and feature engineering will be challenges. 

Also, this project aims to improve your ability to implement algorithms for ***Multi-Class Classification***. Thus, you will have the opportunity to implement many algorithms commonly used for Multi-Class Classification problems.

Before diving into the project, please take a look at the determines and tasks.

Dataset contains tree observations from four areas of one national forest district. This dataset includes information on tree type, shadow coverage, distance to nearby landmarks, soil type, and local topography. The goal of the project is to build a model that predicts what types of trees grow in an area.
***The Forest Dataset*** contains approximately 600 thousand lines, also you can easily find many information about it on the web (especially Kaggle).

To achieve high prediction success, you must understand the data well and develop different approaches that can affect the dependent variable.

Firstly, try to understand the dataset column by column using pandas module. Do research within the scope of domain (forest, trees) knowledge on the internet to get to know the data set in the fastest way. 

You should implement cleaning, handling with outliers and missing values using Pandas, NumPy and other required modules for the best result in modeling. You should do Feature Engineering.

After that, your final dataset with the new variables you have created will be ready for model building. You will implement ***Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, Random Forest, Desicion Tree*** algorithms. Also, evaluate the success of your models with appropriate performance metrics.

At the end of the project, create a chart comparing the performance of all models and choose the most successful model.
