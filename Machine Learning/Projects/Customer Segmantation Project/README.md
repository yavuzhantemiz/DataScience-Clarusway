In this project, customers are required to be segmented according to the purchasing history obtained from the membership cards of a big mall.

This project is less challenging than other projects. After getting to know the data set quickly, you are expected to perform ***Exploratory Data Analysis***. You should observe the distribution of customers according to different variables, also discover relationships and correlations between variables. Then you will spesify the different variables to use for cluster analysis.

Finally, you should clustered customers using the ***K-Means Clustering*** method, after that label the clusters.
