For this project we are using a car dataset, where we want to predict the selling price of car based on its certain features.
Since we need to find the real value, with real calculation, therefore this problem is regression problem. 
We will be using linear regression to solve this problem.

General equation of Multiple Linear Regression:
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}x_1 + \beta_{2}x_2 + \beta_{3}x_3 + \beta_{4}x_4 + ... + \beta_{n}x_n$$
